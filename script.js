//We want a variable assigned to the wins and another to the losses counter
//We a variable assigned to the start button
//We a variable assigned to the dotted line where the objective word will live

//When we load the page we want to check local storage for previous wins and losses
    //if there are none the counters will display as 0/null/none

//When we push the start button we want to initilize the game
    //it needs to track the keys the user presses

//We need an array of words to select from randomly like math.floor (math.random)
//

    //That means want to start the counter
        //we need and if else depending on if the word was completed succesfully or not in time
            //we need to update local storage whenever the total score changes
